# NIMHANS
a form entry application made for NIMHANS , far from perfect , just to show a basic outline

Made in a few hours , highly buggy I think , needs a lot of changes if to be taken forward.

Functionalities that work (Looks ugly though) are :

1. Finger Print scan
2. Core Data for internal Storage
3. Data Entry with a stylus (A writing canvas of sorts and this data gets saved as well)
